## Types of Questions
* Descriptive analyses
the first kind of data analysis performed
most commonly applied to census data
the description and interpretation are different steps
descriptions can usually not be generalized without additional statistical modeling

* Exploratory analyses
goal: find relationahips you didn't know about
exploratory models are good for discovering new connections
they're useful for defining future data science projects
exploratory analyses are usually not the final say
exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing/predicting
correlation does not imply causation

* Inferential analyses
goal: use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population
inferential is commonly the goal of statistical models
inference involves both estimating quantity you care about and your uncertainty about your estimate
inference depends heavily both on the population and the sampling scheme

* Presictive analyses

* Causal analyses

* Mechanistic analyses
