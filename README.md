## Types of Questions
### * Descriptive analyses
goal:
the first kind of data analysis performed  
most commonly applied to census data  
the description and interpretation are different steps  
descriptions can usually not be generalized without additional statistical modeling  

### * Exploratory analyses
goal: find relationahips you didn't know about  
exploratory models are good for discovering new connections  
they're useful for defining future data science projects  
exploratory analyses are usually not the final say  
exploratory analyses alone should not be used for generalizing/predicting  
correlation does not imply causation  

### * Inferential analyses
goal: use a relatively small sample of data to say something about a bigger population  
inferential is commonly the goal of statistical models  
inference involves both estimating quantity you care about and your uncertainty about your estimate  
inference depends heavily both on the population and the sampling scheme  

### * Presictive analyses
goal: to use the data on some objects to predict values for another object  
if X predicts Y it does not mean that X causes Y  
accurate prediction depends heavily on measuring the right variables  
although there are better and worse prediction models, more data and a simple model works really well  
prediction is very hard, especially about the future references  

### * Causal analyses
goal: to find out what happens to one variable when you make another variable change  
usually randmized studies are required to identify causation  
there are approaches to inferring causation in non-randomized studies, but they are complicated and sensitive to assumptions  
causal relationship are usually identified as average effects, but may not apply to every individual  
causal models are usually the "gold standard" for data analysis  

### * Mechanistic analyses
goal: understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables for individual objects  
incredibly hard to infer, except in aimple situations  
usually modeled by a deterministic set of euqations (science/engineering)  
generally the random component of the data is measurement error  
if the equations are known but the parameters are not, they may be inferred with data analysis
